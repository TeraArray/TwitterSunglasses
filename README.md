PUT ON THE GLASSES.

So: on Twitter, the Verified icon is basically a sign of negative quality.

This Chrome extension changes the Twitter Verified Icon into a brown poop emoji.

<b>HOW TO INSTALL</b>

It's simple.  <a href="https://github.com/icze4r/TwitterSunglasses/archive/master.zip">Download the zip</a> of the extension, unzip it, open up chrome://extensions, and drag and drop the unzipped folder into the Extensions panel.

It all works automatically.
